# TFMSTGCA

Final work of the masters on Simulation of tumor growths with cellular automata.

## Introduction

This project pretend to reproduce "Analysis of behaviour transitions in tumour growth using a cellular automaton simulation" paper from José Santos and Ángel Monteagudo (2014).

In this paper, the authors used computational biology as an approach for analysing dynamics of tumor growth at celular level. In detail, they applied cellular automata for modelling behaivor of cells using cancer cell hallmark.

## Dependencies

* [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/). 
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/).
